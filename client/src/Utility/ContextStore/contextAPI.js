      title:"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania", 
      description: " I had a terrific time watching 'Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania', despite hearing 'meh' things about it here and there online. It surpassed my expectations, to be honest. Great cast, entertaining action, super interesting world building (my favourite from the MCU for a while, in that regard) and the humour is good.\n\nStar of the show in my opinion is Michelle Pfeiffer. I don't recall her standing out in 'Ant-Man and the Wasp', but here she's excellent from beginning to end. Elsewhere, Jonathan Majors is brilliant - great to see that guy all over the place recently. Paul Rudd remains a strong lead, while the likes of Michael Douglas and Kathryn Newton are positives too.\n\nLove the Quantum Realm setting. I'm nothing like an MCU nut, I'm only aware of the films, so didn't know what to expect, but the place looks fantastic - from the environment to the creatures; shoutout Veb. Like Pfeiffer, Corey Stoll didn't really register on my radar in prior films, but him as M.O.D.O.K. is a lot of fun.\n\nLooking at my personal MCU ranking, this goes in at no. 8 - I didn't anticipate that! A literal quick glance at the average rating on here suggests I'm in the minority but I truly found much enjoyment from this. Quite the improvement on Ant-Man 2, which is at the bottom of my aforementioned ranking."

      Overview: 'With the price on his head ever increasing, John Wick uncovers a path to defeating The High Table. But before he can earn his freedom, Wick must face off against a new enemy with powerful alliances across the globe and forces that turn old friends into foes.',
      description: "John Wick 4 is an absolute masterpiece of an action film. From start to finish, this movie delivers an adrenaline-fueled experience that will leave you breathless. The action is intense, with each fight scene being expertly choreographed and executed. The action set pieces are some of the most memorable I've ever seen, with each one being more jaw-dropping than the last.\n\nOne of the standout aspects of John Wick 4 is the villains. This time around, they are more interesting than ever, with big-name actors bringing their A-game to their respective roles. It's always great to see veteran actors like Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne on screen, but the addition of newcomers like Bill Skarsgard and Donnie Yen really elevates the movie.\n\nBut perhaps the real star of John Wick 4 is the fight cinematography. The one-take fight scene that was filmed from overhead is a work of art. It's so seamless and fluid that you feel like you're right there in the middle of the action. The attention to detail in every fight scene is astounding, with each punch and kick feeling like it has real weight behind it.\n\nOne slight negative of the movie is that John Wick doesn't have much development. However, this is a minor quibble, as the movie is so focused on delivering incredible action that the lack of character development doesn't really matter. After all, John Wick is at his best when he's kicking ass, and he certainly does that in spades in this movie.\n\nOverall, John Wick 4 is a fantastic entry in the series. The sense of finality that permeates throughout the movie is perfect, and it really feels like a fitting end to the story. If you're a fan of action movies, then John Wick 4 is an absolute must-see. It's a thrilling ride that will leave you on the edge of your seat from start to finish."

When a childhood friend and former boxing prodigy, Damian Anderson, resurfaces after serving a long sentence in prison, he is eager to prove that he deserves his shot in the ring. ',
      description: "This reminded me quite a lot of 'Rocky IV' (1985) only instead of a Russian auto-box doing the challenging, it's 'Damian' (Jonathan Majors). Former champion 'Adonis' (Michael B. Jordan) is living the life of a retired sportsman, wealthy and happy with his family whilst managing the gym with 'Duke' (Wood Harris). Leaving, one afternoon, he discovers a guy sitting on his car and after a quick chat realizes that it's his long-lost childhood pal who has been incarcerated for the last eighteen years. He ('Damian') is now determined to succeed in the ring and so his friend tries to sort it all out - only to discover that this lean, mean, fighting machine has an altogether different agenda and that is going to force the former champ to prove whether or not he still has what it takes. The story is a hybrid of too many others and plays out as predictably as the sun coming up. Add to the mix a degree of familial discord and melodrama and we are left with something largely forgettable that I found to be a pretty poor relation of the previous, much more charismatic and grittier efforts in this franchise. The actual boxing scenes are impressively photographed but there's just no jeopardy - and I'd largely given up. Pretty to look at, yes - but not a great watch."

      description: "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is the perfect farewell to this quirky group of rogues we never expected to love so much.\n\nOur faith in the Marvel Cinematic Universe waned throughout Phase 4 with films that felt hollow, rushed, and insincere. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 rekindled my hope as James Gunn and the cast’s love and passion for these characters shined in every moment of this beautiful, heartfelt send-off. Gunn reminded us of the magic of comic book movies when the storyteller cares more about the characters than the box office. Chris Pratt, Bradley Cooper, Karen Gillan, Dave Bautista, and the rest of the cast pour themselves into entertaining and genuine performances. This film is surprisingly emotional and had me wondering how they convinced me to care so deeply about such a zany group of goofballs, but that they did. Vol. 3 is one of the best conclusions to a film trilogy that had me leave the theater full of satisfaction and nostalgia. While Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is wonderful in nearly every way, if I had a complaint, it would be the soundtrack felt forced at times rather than complimenting strong moments in the first film. The villain wasn’t exceptional but was better than the average Marvel villain, and honestly, Vol. 3 wasn’t about the villain or battles as much as it was a farewell to a family of heroes we have all come to love. This movie is well worth your time, and the fantastic effects and cinematography warrant a trip to the cinema to enjoy it to its fullest! MCU doubters need to set aside their skepticism and enjoy saying goodbye to these beloved characters with this outstanding film."

      description: "The direction and visuals were all fairly good. The visuals looked fine for the majority of the film with no complaints whatsoever, including Ana de Armas’ wig. The direction was good, with some decent action choreography that was filmed pretty well, although there were a few scenes that suffered from too many jump cuts. I thought the intimate scene towards the beginning of the film was very stylistic and done really well. It was not just your standard grunts and moans that you see in so many films today.\n\nThe story was very oddly paced. The beginning section was really rushed, and the romantic build-up did not feel genuine in the slightest. Due to a poor script, their chemistry was non-existent in some sections, as the dialogue was atrocious. While there are some laughs to be had for sure, the majority of the comedy did not work for me. There was heavy use of modern songs throughout the entirety of the film. While some sections were complimented by the tracks, many others felt really out of place.\n\nThe performances were decent, but I think were hindered by the poor script. Ana de Armas was fine, although I never really liked her in anything since Knives Out as her performances always seem a little dull. Chris Evans played a character he's played many times before, which was entertaining, but he could not alone save the terrible dialogue he was given. "

      description: "Shazam! Fury of the Gods is a run-of-the mill superhero sequel that doesn’t progress the genre forward, but delivers two hours of pure entertainment. \n\n This film does not do any one thing great, but it was still a pretty decent watch. The plot is average—nothing we have not seen on the big screen before. Our villains have no development; their motivations are sound, but there is nothing further that develops them into something greater. \n\n This movie starts off incredibly strong, with a fantastic first act that had me laughing hysterically. The comedy hits more often than not, which was a surprise for me. There is a bridge rescue scene that is electric. The combination of I Need a Hero mixed with all of the heroes showcasing their abilities was amazing. I think superhero films have dropped the ball by not showing heroes rescuing everyday people. The stakes have gotten so high outside of the everyday troubles that this art is lost. I really enjoyed that aspect of the film, but unfortunately, after the first act, this story becomes inflated to a point where it is indistinguishable from many other superhero blockbusters.\n\n The final act is overly long and bloated with a plethora of CGI monsters for our heroes to defeat. I think the CGI actually looked pretty good, but it just was not an engaging conclusion for me. The stakes were high, but not built up properly for me to be genuinely interested. The action is pretty decent, but I couldn’t care less. The finale did have emotional beats in terms of the family connection, which worked surprisingly well. That is when this franchise works best. When the focus is on family and not on god's attempts to destroy Earth, \n\n The performances overall were pretty good. Zachary Levi is fantastic as Shazam; he has mastered the art of playing a child in a man's body. Jack Dylan Grazer is hilarious; his comedic timing is brilliant. Grace Caroline Currey is a queen. Rachel Zegler is a standout, and her chemistry with Grazer is top notch. The rest of the Shazamly do a great job as well. I think Helen Mirren and Lucy Liu are fine as antagonists but were wasted with a lack of screen time and development. \n\n Overall, this might not be good, but it is entertaining. That is a lot more than can be said for some of the recently released superhero films (Black Adam and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania). "

      description: "This is certainly a triumph for the visual and audio effects folks. Otherwise, I found it all a bit derivative and frankly a rather classless rehash of the much more entertaining original. It's tough to just keep on re-inventing these themes - they do tire, and as I reckon with the recent updates of the Halloween franchise, they maybe just rely too heavily on a current generation who were not around to see the originals in the cinema first time round, and who maybe just don't appreciate that the acting and the writing - though never exactly crucial to these plots - did have more of a role than just relying on well made-up (virtual) demons spinning around the ceiling emitting threatening shrieks. It's not terrible - it moves along quickly for ninety minutes and might just put you off a bath anytime shortly afterwards, but there just isn't any real sense of menace or jeopardy and to be honest I wasn't entirely sure that the family weren't nightmarish enough - before their visitor arrived.

      Overview: 'During the war in Afghanistan, a local interpreter risks his own life to carry an injured sergeant across miles of grueling terrain.',
      description: "Director Guy Ritchie is no stranger to crafting exciting action films, but his latest project is quite different than his previous work. The narrative is linear, there aren’t any montages, and the story isn’t about criminals, gangsters, or Brits. Fans of Ritchie will absolutely still recognize his visual style (hello, overhead shots) and testosterone-fueled themes, but 'The Covenant' is a more dramatic, mature, and restrained work from the legendary director.\n\nSet during the war in Afghanistan in 2018, the film tells the story of U.S. Army sergeant John Kinley (Jake Gyllenhaal) and his local Afghan interpreter, Ahmed (Dar Salim). Called a traitor by his people for helping the Americans, Ahmed has volunteered to seek revenge against the Taliban that killed his son. He has also been promised visas for his service so his family can flee to safety in America. After a lethal ambush in the desert, Kinley is gravely injured by enemy fire. With his platoon gone, Ahmed refuses to leave a fellow soldier behind to die, so he drags Kinley through the mountainous terrain in order to get him back to the base for medical help.\n\nThe film tells the story of their 100 mile journey, but then pivots to Kinley’s return to the United States. It’s months after he gets home that Kinley learns Ahmed and his family were not given safe passage as promised and, as a way to repay the debt he owes his friend, he returns to Afghanistan to retrieve them. It won’t be easy, because Ahmed has been placed at the top of the Taliban’s most wanted hit list.\n\nIt’s a meaningful story of honor and brotherhood wrapped up in an intense wartime thriller. The story is told in three major acts, from the early days Ahmed and Kinley spent chasing IEDs, to their dangerous journey, to the red tape of getting a man what he’s owed. There are plenty of thrilling acting sequences throughout, and they will keep you on the edge of your seat.\n\nRitchie has an extraordinary sense of timing and instincts for shooting action scenes, and the brutal, graphic wartime violence puts you in the be-or-be-killed survival mind of a front line soldier."

      description: " Seven Kings Must Die is the conclusion of The Last Kingdom series. A conclusion that didn't feel necessary as the story ended with a satisfying resolution and characters we had grown to love over five seasons finding happiness and a rewarding future. Instead, this 2-hour movie is more of a finale that disrupts our story's happy ending and leaves it all with less closure than before. With the promise of a movie, I was hoping that the film would enjoy greater production quality and resources than the typical show, but that was not the case. Seven Kings Must Die was just an entire season of The Last Kingdom crammed into 2 hours. Fans of the series might enjoy seeing more of their favorite characters (although they might be disappointed with the conclusion of those characters' stories). Unfortunately, those unfamiliar with The Last Kingdom would be confused by the partial narrative they receive with this film. Seven King Must Die might have been a decent finale to an additional season of the show, but as someone who liked how the show ended, I wish I had joined my wife and gone to bed without finishing the film. The show is excellent, so watch that instead. It really isn't as bad as I am sharing, but I was happier as a fan without it, and non-fans would probably not find it worth their time, either."

I'm enclined to blame the casting here. Well, the story was lacking and oddly edited as well, but it may be because there wasn't much to work with. Either way, it's clear this is supposed to be about a mother/daughter relationship, but also be an action move and the director / writers / actors couldn't make it work. 3/10, 2 points cause I've seen worse, not because I can find something positive in it.

Scared that he’ll be labelled a loser all his life, he attempts to commit suicide by jumping from a high rise. He survives but the doctor treating him, Dr Kasbekar (Shishir Sharma) makes it clear that the chances of him recovering are slim. Anni is obviously heartbroken and with no option in hand, he decides to adopt a novel method to ensure that Raghav gets the will to live.

The students of H4 always lose miserably and are the last among the ten hostels. Hence, the ‘Loser’ tag."

In the meantime, Pakistani terrorist outfits carry out an attack at Uri Army Base camp in Kashmir. Vihaan’s childhood friend and brother-in-law Captain Karan Kashyap (Mohit Raina) along with some other fellow army mates are martyred in this attack. Following this, Vihaan is forced back by emotions to extract revenge by leading the strike force. Vihaan puts together a team to conduct the surgical strike under the guidance of PMO bigwig Govind Bhardwaj (Paresh Rawal) with special orders from PM (Rajit Kapur) himself. Special Agent Pallavi (Yami Gautam) helps Vihaan to detect the location of the launch pads and details of the target. And what follows is the execution of the surgical strikes across PoK. "

The film is about a childlike innocent character who in search of his 'property', comes face to face with the reality of human race and their selfish motives.\n\nThe story starts when PK (Aamir Khan) loses his 'property', without which he is left homeless on an unknown desert. Devastated with this incident, he goes in search of the man responsible for this, without even knowing any details of him. While people advice him to take the help of God, PK too sets out in search of 'God'. Gradually, he realizes that God isn't a 'single person' as there are different Gods and to reach him there are his 'messengers' (read 'Godmen'). That's when he comes across Tapasvi (Saurabh Shukla), who fools people stating that he has the proof of God's existence. "

The Americans are angry and they launch an attack on Abu and his convoy, and it injures Abu. At the same time, a group of 40 nurses – 25 Indian and 15 Pakistani – are heading to the hospital where they work. Abu’s men force the nurses to take an injured Abu with them for immediate treatment. They also take over the hospital and keep the nurses as hostage. The Americans then decide to launch an airstrike on the hospital within 7 days. Hence, the Indians have just a week to rescue the nurses. Infiltrating into the high security ISC region is next to impossible. The senior officer of RAW, Shenoy (Girish Karnad) suggests that Tiger should be called in as he’s the only one who can successfully complete this mission. Tiger is found and he takes up the job.

She's the archetypical seedhi-saadhi girl, Plain Jane actually, an academician who's focused on attaining what she's zeroed for herself as a career. Add two more characters who cross their paths in this beautiful journey called life. Now place these four straight-out-of-life characters in a bottle, shake with a swizzle stick and presto, a love story is ready to be served.\n\nCome to think of it, Ayan Mukerjis second outing YEH JAWAANI HAI DEEWANI is akin to his accomplished directorial debut WAKE UP SID. Yet diverse! The characters in both, WAKE UP SID and YEH JAWAANI HAI DEEWANI, undergo a metamorphosis and transform into mature individuals with the passage of time. Life is a great teacher after all. At the same time, YEH JAWAANI HAI DEEWANI is dissimilar from films of its ilk -- and conventional love stories too -- because Ayans characters never embark upon the run of the mill, mundane route to express feelings towards each other.\n\nLike all rom-coms, YEH JAWAANI HAI DEEWANI sparkles with romance, merriment and heartache, is brightly glossy and boasts of crackling chemistry between its lead actors, but Ayan makes sure the heady concoction never waters down. The best part is, he never borrows from romantic cliches that most love stories depend upon and that, in my opinion, is this films biggest strength. Expect no unwanted melodrama, no unwelcome characters, no earsplitting background music to accentuate the proceedings... the best thing about YEH JAWAANI HAI DEEWANI is that its refreshingly unique within the conventional Hindi film format.

It, therefore, tells the story of Shiva’s father, Amarendra Bahubali. In a sense, the second film in the series is a prequel to the first one as a major part of the second film deals with the flashback about Amarendra Bahubali.\n\nIn the present film, it is shown that Amarendra Bahubali has been brought up by Sivagami along with her own son, Bhalaladev. In fact, Sivagami has decided to make Amarendra Bahubali the king of Mahishmati kingdom, much to the shock of her husband (Nasser) and son, Bhalaladev (Rana Daggubati). However, on the day of the coronation, Sivagami makes Bhalaladev the king because Amarendra Bahubali wants to marry Devasena against Sivagami’s wishes. Sivagami has, a few days back, promised her son that she would get him married to Devasena but, unaware of his mother’s promise to Bhalaladev, Amarendra Bahubali has promised Devasena that he would marry her and look after her all his life. Even Deva­sena is keen to wed Amarendra Bahubali as she has fallen in love with him.\n\nUnhappy with Amarendra Bahubali’s stand, Sivagami appoints Bhalaladev as the king, and Amarendra Bahubali as merely his lieutenant. Although Bahubali marries Devasena, the couple does not have the blessings of Sivagami. Soon, Devasena gets pregnant with Amarendra Baahubali’s child. Before she can deliver the child, Amarendra Bahubali and Devasena are thrown out of the palace by Sivagami due to the machinations of Bhalaladev and his father. As if this were not bad enough, Katappa kills Amarendra Bahubali on the very day Devasena gives birth to their child. Why Katappa had murdered Baahubali is revealed by him (Katappa) to Shiva who has realised that he is actually Amarendra’s 25-year-old son, Mahendra Bahubali.\n\nIt is now the turn of Shiva alias Mahendra Bahubali to avenge his father’s murder and his mother, Devasena’s captivity by Bhalaladev for 25 long years. What happens then? Who eliminates whom? And who lives happily thereafter? Who rules Mahishmati kingdom? "

They had expected to rule KGF and take over its immense wealth. However, Rocky, with the help of the slaves who consider him a messiah, usurps the throne. He even kills Virat (Vinay Bidappa), brother of Garuda and the heir apparent to the KGF throne. Rocky however spares Vanaram (Ayyappa P Sharma), the commander of the army at KGF. Vanaram, angry at first, joins Rocky and trains young kids who become the new guards of the territory. Rocky discovers that there are several unexcavated mines in the area and he orders the men to start extracting gold from these places. The idea is to discover as much gold as possible in the shortest possible time. Meanwhile, Adheera (Sanjay Dutt), brother of Suryavardhan, the founder of KGF, was presumed dead. However, he is alive and arrives at KGF for revenge and to claim ownership. He smartly gets Rocky out of KGF and shoots him. He allows Rocky to survive so that the word is spread in KGF that the terrifying Adheera is here. Rocky recuperates but realizes that no one is able to move out of KGF as Adheera’s men have surrounded the mines. Meanwhile, Shetty (Dinesh Mangaluru), Rocky’s ex-boss in Bombay, has tied up with fellow gangsters across West and South India, and plans to act against Rocky. They are also dealing with Inayat Khalil (Balakrishna), a dreaded gangster from Dubai. How Rocky fights all these elements forms the rest of the film."

      description: " 3 IDIOTS belongs to everyone. But, yes, there's no denying that Aamir makes you forget all his past achievements as you watch the amazing actor play Rancho. To state that this ranks amongst his finest works would be an understatement. Madhavan is incredible, especially in the sequence when he explains his point of view to his father [Pareekshit Sahani]. Sharman is outstanding from start to end. This was a difficult role to portray and only an actor of calibre could've pulled it off. Boman is superb as the vicious head of the institute. The scenes between Aamir and Boman are extra-ordinary and it's a treat to watch these two powerful actors clash on the big screen, without getting overdramatic. Boman's appearance, mannerisms and dialogue delivery are exemplary.\n\nThe length of Kareena's role may not be as much as Aamir, Madhavan and Sharman, but she registers a strong impact nonetheless. Omi is excellent and the viewers are sure to love his acidic tongue and gestures in the movie. Mona Singh doesn't get much scope. Jaaved Jaffery is competent. Pareekshit Sahani is decent.\n\nOn the whole, 3 IDIOTS easily ranks amongst Aamir, Rajkumar Hirani and Vidhu Vinod Chopra's finest films. Do yourself and your family a favour: Watch 3 IDIOTS. It's emotional, it's entertaining, it's enlightening. The film has tremendous youth appeal and feel-good factor to work in a big way."

Anand Kumar (Hrithik Roshan) has completed his graduation and is passionate about mathematics. He’s so good in the subject that he is felicitated at the hands of the education minister (Pankaj Tripathi). Anand manages to solve a complex mathematical problem, which has baffled scholars all around the world. His feat lands him a seat in the prestigious Cambridge University. His father Eshwar Kumar (Virendra Saxena) is a postman who takes out his PF to fund Anand’s foreign education. When the money falls short, he and Anand knock at the doors of the education minister, who had promised him help. But the minister refuses to help. Meanwhile, Eshwar passes away one day suddenly. He was the only earning member of the family and hence, Anand sheds his ambition and begins selling papad to survive. One day, he bumps into Lallan Singh (Aditya Srivastava) who runs Excellence Coaching Centre, an institute for those giving the IIT-JEE exams. He is aware of Anand’s brilliance in mathematics since he was in the college when Anand was felicitated. He gets Anand enrolled in his coaching institute as a premium teacher. Since Anand’s teaching methods guarantee success, he becomes quite sought after. Excellence Coaching Centre management even promote themselves by using Anand’s picture on their banners. Anand’s financial condition also improves as he’s even made one of the signatories. However, he soon realizes that some brilliant students aren’t getting a fair chance to excel in life because of their underprivileged background. Overnight, Anand quits Excellence Coaching Centre. He starts his own centre, where he decides to teach 30 students for IIT entrance exams for free. Not just that, he even arranges for their accommodation and food. Lallan obviously is livid and he tries his best to persuade Anand. When nothing works, he tries to demotivate Anand, saying that all his students who fail will go back to their impoverished lives. It’s important that each and every student of Anand manages to crack the IIT exam. What happens next forms the rest of the film. "

It was a feeding frenzy. \n\n Of course, we love salmon. It’s a great source of nutrition and protein and, when cooked well, it gently slides apart into buttery, juicy, delightful little flakes.\n\n But I’m not going to lie to you: the main event here is that mango corn salsa. \n\n The salmon itself is completely SOS (taco seasoning and THAT’S IT), which is why I think it makes sense to put all your effort and energy into the salsa. This salsa is also the thing that’s going to keep you sitting at the table long after you’re done eating tacos, just scooping some extra salsa bites all on its own and suddenly thinking of it as more of a salad? It can be a salad, right? I would totally eat this salsa on its own as a salad. \n\n Each bite is extra crispy and unexpected from the raw sweet corn and cucumber with a little burst of juicy flavor. But it’s also mainstream enough with the mango that my two young kids are usually happy to devour it right along with us. \n\n I love a million sauces on my tacos (okay, fine, on every recipe). But with this one, all it needs is a bit of extra lime and honey to finish it off. Simple, minimal effort, max deliciousness."

I often end up eating it right over the stove in a moment of pure and absolute joy. \n\nAnd luckily, the components can work for everybody (buttered noodles is always a kid win, plus eggs and broccoli!), so it can be easily worked into something family-friendly or meal-prep friendly if you batch some extra broccoli and eggs to throw into other meals throughout the week. SOS at its finest. \n\n The miso just does something magical to this whole thing – if you don’t have it I think you’ll still end up just fine. But if you have it (hopefully I already convinced you to buy some with the Miso Crunch Salad!) it will elevate the flavor and add a depth that’s just really amazing for such a fast and easy recipe."

Find out more about the bucket list here.\n\n I know it might be confusing – carrot cake, which is like vegetables meets cake, but also still cake, combined with coffee cake, which is also cake but the kind you can eat for breakfast and it will still be totally appropriate and, obviously, cakey? \n\n But no need to be confused. \n\n If you like a carrot cake that tastes just slightly cinnamony and teeters perfectly between springy and dense… \n\n And you like a coffee cake that is loaded with a mega amount of streusel topping… \n\n And you like cakes that look beautiful and taste even more beautiful with a proper shmear of honey butter… \n\ nI HELLO! Meet your one true match. This one is for you. "

Best. Of. Both. Worlds. \n\n My second favorite thing about these cookies is that they also just shine, and I mean really shine, with rich, deep, caramelly flavor thanks to a whole lot of browned butter. "

I've seen tons of AR and VR headsets, but very few unique peripherals designed to work together with these future goggles and glasses. Instead of gaming or social experiences, Spacetop's main pitch is to turn laptops into AR-assisted devices with endless virtual displays. \n\n If that sounds like a weird pitch, consider that I've already lived it. I've paired Meta's Quest Pro to my laptop to extend its virtual monitors around my head, and plenty of solutions like this already exist using available apps. The interfaces can be clunky, and the hardware isn't totally made to be mobile. Spacetop's keyboard base, with its own Qualcomm processor inside, acts as a spatially tracked anchor that the AR glasses can follow and track the floating displays to. The tracking can work while in motion in a car or plane, and a button on the keyboard can make the floating displays vanish for an in-room conversation with someone, toggling the virtual screens on and off.

My favorite is the 18-wheelers driving around the site'. \n\n  'The rumble sounds better than before.'\n\n  Christine struggled to hear out of her left ear for her whole life. In March, she was prescribed her first pair of hearing aids. In addition to dramatically improving her hearing, they also notably improved her balance. \n\n Christine is one of the 38 million Americans who have some degree of hearing loss. Hers was genetic, but many more are put at risk by exposure to loud noises. The World Health Organization estimates that over a billion young adults are at risk of hearing loss 'due to unsafe listening practices.' "

      description: "OpenAI continues to develop ChatGPT -- the company began rolling out plugins for the AI chatbot last month -- but has denied it's working on GPT-5 yet following an open letter signed by Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak and others at the end of March. The letter urged labs to take at least a six-month pause in artificial intelligence development due to the 'profound risks' to society.\n\n In February, Microsoft entered the AI chatbot realm with Bing AI search, which makes use of ChatGPT, and for which Microsoft earlier this week launched widgets on Android and iOS. Rival Google followed with AI Bard in March. The waitlist to try Bard has now been removed, with the service publicly available as of this week. \n\n Chinese giant Alibaba also unveiled a ChatGPT rival, with both Chinese and English capabilities, while Tesla and Twitter CEO Elon Musk has created an artificial intelligence company called X.AI. \n\n CNET has broken down the performance of ChatGPT, Bing and Google Bard to work out which AI chatbot is the most helpful.

The talks would center on developing an international framework 'to achieve the common vision and goal of trustworthy AI,' the bulletin says.\n\n 'These discussions could include topics such as governance, safeguard of intellectual property rights including copy rights, promotion of transparency, response to foreign information manipulation, including disinformation, and responsible utilization of these technologies,' the bulletin says.\n\n Though it's unclear what exactly might come of the talks, the G-7's focus on AI is another sign that people in high places are aware of the worries around the technology and are cautious about letting its development continue unfettered. The G-7's bulletin follows other recent moves by government to examine and address AI and its potential perils."

      title: "Google's AI Search Could Mean Radical Changes for Your Internet Experience",
      Overview:"At Google I/O, the company unveiled an experimental version of Search that integrates AI-generated responses. Will it break the balance of the internet?.",
      description: "The future of Google Search is a big green box. \n\n That's exactly what Google showed off this month at Google I/O, the company's yearly developer conference. The theme for 2023 was AI, a term mentioned more than 140 times during the two-hour keynote presentation. Google unveiled AI products that will actually be released to the public, an about-face for the apprehensive internet giant in response to growing competition. \n\n  Late last year, OpenAI launched ChatGPT to near-universal adulation. Suddenly, everybody had access to a generative AI engine that could seemingly answer any question with a novel response. It's powered by a large language model, or LLM, that essentially lets it act as 'autocomplete on steroids,' using massive amounts of text data to figure out what the next best word should be.  \n\n  The power and ease of ChatGPT helped it become the fastest growing consumer web platform ever. It prompted Microsoft to up its investment into OpenAI and integrate ChatGPT's tech directly into Bing search earlier this year, a move that helped the company see a 16% increase in traffic. The day before Microsoft unveiled Bing AI, Google announced its own generative AI engine, Bard, although it flubbed the launch and lost $100 billion in stock market value in the process. The stock has since rebounded to its highest level so far this year. \n\n  In many ways, Google I/O was a referendum on the company's wonky entrance into consumer AI and a clear message to skeptics (and investors) that it's willing to take radical steps to stay at the forefront of internet search, even if that means upending its core product. Google Search has long been the engine for how we all look for product information, find the latest news and otherwise interact with the internet, and for how many businesses make money. "

These three security issues relate to WebKit, the internet browser engine used in Safari and developed by Apple. \n\n One of these issues could disclose sensitive information to a third party, and another could allow a third party to execute commands on your device without your knowledge. Fixes for these issues are in 16.5 for anyone who missed the release of the first iPhone Rapid Security Response, iOS 16.4.1 (a). The third issue could allow a third party access to more information across your device than is allowed.\n\n The iOS update also patches an issue where someone could access your contacts from your lock screen. While Apple has provided ways to customize your lock screen, some people have run into issues where the lock screen can allow others to access some iPhone features, like replying to messages and even your Wallet."
